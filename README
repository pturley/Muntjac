Muntjac is a tool that helps technical leaders on large projects see only the commits of their team members in a shared git repository.


Why Muntjac?
Well, the muntjac is a barking deer whos dung is harvested to make coffee.  Similarly to our project, the muntjac deer eats many coffee beans, but only outputs the good ones.

The coffee that they produce is called kopi muncak.

Mmmmmmmmm
